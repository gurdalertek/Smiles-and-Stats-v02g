## Smiles & Stats GPT
Data analytics GPT for automatically analyzing World Happiness dataset
Code and original GPT developed by Shouq Alzahmi, Maryam Ezzaza, and Jawaher Alyammahi.
Later versions and Prompt Set - v08g developed by Gurdal Ertek and deployed under ChatGPT.

## Inspiration
1. Extracting meaningful insights from vast amounts of information can be overwhelming. 
2. Many individuals and businesses have access to a wealth of data and even the tools to analyze data but do not have the skills or time.
3. Transforming raw data into actionable insights remains a challenge.
4. Traditionally, data analytics required either expert knowledge in data analysis or significant time investment. 
5. This limits the ability of people to make data-driven decisions quickly and efficiently.
6. Most users simply want clear, easy-to-understand insights.
7. They want to analyze data without needing a deep background in analytics.
8. They want to generate standard reports fast.

## What Smiles & Stats GPT does
1. Our project, *Smiles & Stats GPT* simplifies and automates the process of turning raw data into structured, insightful reports. 
2. The tool runs the GPT engine of ChatGPT and runs under ChatGPT.
3. The tool automatically analyzes the World Happiness dataset and generates the standard comprehensive annual reports in a very short amount of time. 


## Key features include:
1. Automated Report Generation: With just a dataset and minimal interaction, the GPT engine generates a full report, complete with analysis, visual representations, and clear, actionable insights.
2. Visual Data Representation: The reports come equipped with graphs, charts, and infographics to make complex data easy to digest.
3. Readily constructed prompts eliminate the need for users to even think about what analysis is needed.
4. No-code solution, that can be extended by anyone.

## How we built it
Sources & Tools used: WorldHappiness.report, ChatGPT Plus 4.0, Talking.Network for Voice Generation (Emma AI)
1. We dissected all the different analyses in the standard annual WorldHappines.report report. 
2. We constructed the corresponding prompts that will yield the same results as much as possible.
3. We added interactivity to the GPT.
4. We also created new sample data, different from the readily published data. 
5. After deploying the GPT under ChatGPT, we tested it extensively.

## Challenges we ran into
- Creating a balance between detailed analysis and simplicity.
- While we want simplicity and automation, we also need to allow for interactivity.
- Developing the interactivity with the user.
- Preventing ChatGPT from inserting its own analyses.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
- Built a tool that turns raw data into professional reports in just a few minutes and minimal prompts. 
- User-friendly no-code solutions.
- Enabling data science and fact-based decision-making for the selected domain for anyone.

## What we learned
- We learned how to strike the right balance between detailed data interpretation and user-friendly design.
- This was our first GPT. We learned a lot about developing a GPT and deploying it.

## What's next for Smiles & Stats GPT
- Expanding customization options for report generation.
- Enhancing the AIâ€™s ability to provide deeper analysis based on user preferences.
- Exploring more advanced visualizations and complex analyses, including machine learning (ML).
